4. This project uses cretejs. I made a bit of responsive effect on the background and animated the movie as near the actual movie that I got. The final animation would require a bit more dedication on exactly when each light goes up, which is quite easy to set in the code. As per background image, I soreted it out a bit in pdf, but final product would need to have a bit more dedication on graphics and maybe bigger resolution of the image provided.
